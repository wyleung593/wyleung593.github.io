        <p>City University's origins lie in the calls for a "second polytechnic" in the years following the 1972 establishment of the Hong Kong Polytechnic. In 1982, Executive Council member Chung Sze-yuen spoke of a general consensus that "a second polytechnic of similar size to the first should be built as soon as possible."[3] District administrators from Tuen Mun and Tsuen Wan lobbied the government to build the new institution in their respective new towns.[3] The government instead purchased temporary premises at the new Argyle Centre Tower II in Mong Kok, a property developed by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation in concert with the then-Argyle station. The new school was called City Polytechnic of Hong Kong, a name chosen among nearly 300 suggestions made by members of the public.[4]</p>

        <p>The new polytechnic opened on <em><strong>8 October 1984</strong></em>, welcoming 480 full-time and 680 part-time students.[5] The provision for part-time students contributed to high enrolment, with the quota being filled almost immediately.[5]</p>

          <p>City University of Hong Kong occupies an urban campus located in Kowloon. The official address is Tat Chee Avenue,[12] Kowloon Tong, Kowloon. Administratively, it is part of Sham Shui Po District.[13] Certain buildings of the main campus are marked as located in the Shek Kip Mei neighbourhood instead of Kowloon Tong in the official address book, such as Nam Shan Building.[14]</p>

            <p>The main campus is connected to the Festival Walk shopping centre and the Kowloon Tong MTR station, which serves the East Rail line and Kwun Tong line of Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system. It is also adjacent to Shek Kip Mei Park and Nam Shan Estate.</p>

            <p>The main campus covers around 15.6 ha (39 acres).</p>
