        <p>City University's origins lie in the calls for a "second polytechnic" in the years following the 1972 establishment of the Hong Kong Polytechnic. In 1982, Executive Council member Chung Sze-yuen spoke of a general consensus that "a second polytechnic of similar size to the first should be built as soon as possible."[3] District administrators from Tuen Mun and Tsuen Wan lobbied the government to build the new institution in their respective new towns.[3] The government instead purchased temporary premises at the new Argyle Centre Tower II in Mong Kok, a property developed by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation in concert with the then-Argyle station. The new school was called City Polytechnic of Hong Kong, a name chosen among nearly 300 suggestions made by members of the public.[4]</p>

        <p><blockquote>The new polytechnic opened on <em><strong>8 October 1984</strong></em>, welcoming 480 full-time and 680 part-time students.[5] The provision for part-time students contributed to high enrollment, with the quota being filled almost immediately.[5]</blockquote>
